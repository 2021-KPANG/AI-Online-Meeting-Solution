So I'm happy to report we have succeeded in routing our flagships way ahead of schedule yet. Again. This is allowed us to improve our USPS by 90% That's nine out of every ten. Excellent. Thank you Samuel Timothy. What's the status with the linear solutions? Could you give us the latest on the Square project? The Linea Solutions department has yet again functioned at full capacity and we have fulfilled a hundred and
 14% of this month's objectives, you can read the handouts for a detailed account but in short as I reported last week, we've decided to use the right angle for the square project that the still some debate as to how big a right angle is. So we're testing currently at 90 97 a hundred and a hundred and one degrees as agreed. I've ensured Anderson cross checks the design removing any left angles and doesn't use them in future. Overall. We have very good progress with
 Design, are we on track with a schedule? When are we required to start delivering? I'm happy to report that we are ready to start first deliveries tomorrow, which is way ahead of the requested delivery schedule. We've only just finished system testing the Prototype and are only halfway through performance testing. We haven't even released an alpha version yet. As I said earlier, we've had very good progress with the design. Yes. We've had very good progress. But I'd say the design of the product is only 75 percent complete well
 Exactly, that's three out of every four. So we're ready to start shipping tomorrow. What if it doesn't work like that?
 Who produce say for units, but only ship the first three then when you're finally a hundred percent complete with the design we can then ship the fourth.
 Excellent work Timothy. You can proceed with the production and send me please a revised delivery schedule so I can share it with a client. Well, thank you everyone. This was very productive yet again.
